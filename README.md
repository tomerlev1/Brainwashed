#"Brainwashed" - a blog project by me :D 

In this project I used several technologies that I taught myself such as: 
* Mongoose&MongoDB for the Database, 
* NodeJS for the server 
* and JS, EJS, HTML5, CSS3 for the frontend of my blog.

I learnd a lot from this project about ways to protect a site from hacking and code injections
And I used a few ways to avoid it.

On the client side, he can register on my website and start to manage his own blog,
as well as choose if the new post will be able for global viewing or only a private one.

The overall look I've designed by myself (so it presents my own taste):
